AWS Data Analytic Platform for the City of Vancouver
This repository showcases the development of a scalable and secure Data Analytic Platform (DAP) using AWS services to address urban challenges faced by the City of Vancouver. This project was undertaken as part of the BUSI 653: Cloud Computing Technologies course.
Project Overview
The DAP is divided into two phases:

Phase 1: Design and initial implementation, focusing on illegal dumping cases.
Phase 2: Expansion to analyze high water consumption concerns and graffiti incidents.
The platform leverages AWS tools for data ingestion, profiling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to aid the City of Vancouver in data-driven decision-making.
